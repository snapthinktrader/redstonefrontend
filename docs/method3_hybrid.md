# Method 3: Hybrid Approach (Best of Both)

## How it works:
1. App has fallback URL compiled at build time
2. App tries to fetch latest URL from remote config
3. If remote config fails, use fallback URL
4. Cache successful remote URLs for offline use

## Implementation:
```dart
class HybridConfig {
  // Compiled at build time (fallback)
  static const String fallbackUrl = 'https://stable-backend.com/api';
  
  // Fetched at runtime (preferred)
  static Future<String> getBackendUrl() async {
    try {
      // Try to get latest URL from remote
      final remoteUrl = await fetchRemoteConfig();
      if (remoteUrl != null) {
        return remoteUrl;
      }
    } catch (e) {
      print('Remote config failed, using fallback');
    }
    
    // Use fallback if remote fails
    return fallbackUrl;
  }
}
```

## Pros:
✅ Reliable fallback system
✅ Can update URL remotely when needed
✅ Works offline
✅ Simple for users
✅ Flexible for developers

## Cons:
❌ Slightly more complex than build-time only
❌ Still need APK rebuild for fallback URL changes

## Best Practices:
1. Use stable custom domain as fallback
2. Remote config for temporary URL changes
3. Cache remote URLs locally
4. Graceful degradation if remote fails

## When to use:
- Production applications
- Need reliability + flexibility
- Want remote control but with safety net
- Professional deployment requirements
